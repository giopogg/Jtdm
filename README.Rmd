# jtdm - Joint trait distribution modeling

## About the method

The package jtdm implements the method described in Poggiato et al., in prep. Joint models and predictions of community traits. The code for producing the results in this paper is available under the subfolder publications in this repo.

## Installing the R package

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("giopogg/jtdm")
```

## Fit a jtdm to data

The package implements jtdm by sampling from the posterior distribution of the parameters, which has been analytically determined. Therefore, there is no need for classical MCMC convergence checks. 

Fitting a JTDM the case study dataset of Poggiato et al. In prep.

```{r,warning=FALSE,results='hide'}
library(jtdm)
library(ggplot2)
set.seed(1712)
data(Y)
data(X)
# Short MCMC to obtain a fast example: results are unreliable !
m = jtdm_fit(Y=Y, X=X, formula=as.formula("~GDD+FDD+forest"), sample = 1000)

# Inferred parameters
getB(m)$Bmean
get_sigma(m)$Smean 
```

### Show inferred model

We can have a first look to regression coefficients using the `summary` function

```{r,warning=FALSE,results='hide'}
summary(m)

```

And we can plot the regression coefficients and the residual covariance matrix
```{r,warning=FALSE,results='hide'}
plot(m)
```

###Trait-environment relationships

Single-trait trait-environment relationships
``` {r}
partial_response(m,indexGradient="GDD",indexTrait="SLA",FixX=list(GDD=NULL,FDD=NULL,forest=1))$p
```

### Joint trait-environment relationships
 
 
Partial response curve of the most suitable community-level strategy and envelop of possible community-level strategies of SLA and LNC along the GDD gradient.

```{r}
ellipse_plot(m,indexTrait = c("SLA","LNC"),indexGradient="GDD")
```

### Joint probabilities
Computes joint probabilities of both SLA and LNC to be greater than 20 in a high altitude site. This measures the relative suitability of communities where both SLA and LNC are higher than 20 in a high altitude site.

```{r}
joint_trait_prob(m,indexTrait=c("SLA","LNC"), Xnew=X["VCHA_2940",], bounds=list(c(20,Inf),c(20,Inf)))$PROBmean

```


Unsurprisingly, the probability is low. Then, we compute how this probability varies along the GDD gradient.
``` {r}
joint=joint_trait_prob_gradient(m,indexTrait=c("SLA","LNC"), indexGradient="GDD", bounds=list(c(mean(Y[,"SLA"]),Inf),c(mean(Y[,"SLA"]),Inf)))
```


And we plot it.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
table = data.frame(x=joint$gradient, mean= joint$GradProbsmean,
                                   q02 = joint$GradProbsq025,
                                   q97 = joint$GradProbsq975)
ggplot(data=table) + geom_ribbon(mapping=aes(x=x, ymin=q02, ymax=q97),position = position_dodge(0.3), size=1,alpha=0.2) + geom_line(mapping=aes(x=x, y=mean), size=1, position=position_dodge(width=0.3),col="#F8766D") + xlab("GDD")  + theme_classic() +              ggtitle("Joint probability of SLA and LNC to be both greater than 10 as a function of GDD")
```


As climatic conditions become more favorable (i.e. GDD increases), the probability of having high values of both traits increases.
