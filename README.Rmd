# jtdm - Joint trait distribution modeling

## About the method

The method is described in Poggiato et al., in prep. Joint models and predictions of community traits. The code for producing the results in this paper is available under the subfolder publications in this repo.

The method itself is implemented in this repo.

## Installing the R package

### R-package

Install the package via
```{r,eval=FALSE}
install_github("giopogg/jtdm")
```

The package implements jtdm using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian modeling software JAGS via the R package runjags. Therefore, it requires the installation of both JAGS and runjags. 

Once the dependencies are installed, the following code should run:

Fits a JTDM
```{r}
library(jtdm)
library(ggplot2)
set.seed(1712)
data(Y)
data(X)
# Short MCMC to obtain a fast example: results are unreliable !
m = jtdm_fit(Y=Y, X=X, formula=as.formula("~GDD+FDD+forest"),  adapt = 10, burnin = 100, sample = 100)

# Inferred parameters
getB(m)$Bmean
get_sigma(m)$Smean
```

Computes joint probabilities of both SLA and LNC to be greater than 10 in the sites of the study.
```{r}
joint = joint_trait_prob(m,indexTrait=c("SLA","LNC"), bounds=list(c(mean(Y[,"SLA"]),Inf),c(mean(Y[,"SLA"]),Inf)))

```
