\usage{
partial_response(
  m,
  indexGradient,
  indexTrait,
  XFocal = NULL,
  grid.length = 200,
  FixX = NULL,
  FullPost = "mean"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{a model fitted with \code{jtdm_fit}}

\item{indexGradient}{The name (as specified in the column names of X) of the focal variable.}

\item{indexTrait}{The name (as specified in the column names of Y) of the focal trait.}

\item{XFocal}{Optional. A gradient of the focal variable provided by the user. If provided, the function will used this gradient instead of building a regular one. Default to NULL.}

\item{grid.length}{The number of points along the gradient of the focal variable. Default to 200.}

\item{FixX}{Optional. A parameter to specify the value to which non-focal variables are fixed. This can be useful for example if we have some categorical variables (e.g. forest vs meadows) and we want to obtain the partial response curve for a given value of the variable. It has to be a list of the length and names of the columns of X. For example, if the columns of X are "MAT","MAP","Habitat" and we want to fix "Habitat" to 1, then FixX=list(MAT=NULL,MAP=NULL,Habitat=1.). Default to NULL.}

\item{FullPost}{The type of predictions to be obtain. If FullPost = TRUE, the function returns samples from the predictive distribution. If FullPost="mean", the function computes the posterior distribution of the regression term B\%*\%X). Default to "mean", here FullPost cannot be FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list containing:\tabular{ll}{
   \code{p} \tab A plot of the trait-environment relationship. \cr
   \tab \cr
   \code{predictions} \tab A data frame containing the predicted trait-environmental relationships including the gradient of the focal environmental variable, mean trait predictions and quantiles (can be useful to code customized plot). \cr
}
}
\description{
Computes and plots the trait-environment relationship of a given CWM trait and a focal environmental variable. In order to build the response curve, the function builts a dataframe where the focal environmental variable varies along a gradient and the other (non-focal) variables are fixed to their mean (but see FixX parameter for fixing non-focal variables to user-defined values).
